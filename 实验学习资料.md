### Hash table

Hash tables (hashmaps) combine linked list and arrays to  provide an efficient data structure for storing dynamic data.  Hash tables are commonly implemented as an array of linked  lists (hash tables with chaining).

- Each data item is associated with a key that determines its  location.  
- Hash functions are used to generate an evenly distributed  hash value. 
- A hash collision is said to occur when two items have the same hash value.  
- Items with the same hash keys are chained 
- Retrieving an item is O(1) operation.

Hash functions:

- A hash function maps its input into a finite range: hash  value, hash code.  
- The hash value should ideally have uniform distribution.  why?  
- Other uses of hash functions: cryptography, caches  (computers/internet), bloom filters etc.  
- Hash function types:  
  - Division type  
  - Multiplication type  
- Other ways to avoid collision: linear probing, double  hashing. 

```c
#define MAX_BUCKETS 1000
#define MULTIPLIER 31
struct wordrec
{
    char *word;
    unsigned long count;
    struct wordrec *next;
};
/* hash bucket */
struct wordrec *table[MAX_LEN];
```

```c
unsigned long hashs_tring(const char *str)
{
    unsigned long hash = 0;
    while (*str)
    {
        hash = hash * MULTIPLIER + *str;
        str++;
    }
    return hash % MAX_BUCKETS;
}
```

```c
struct wordrec *lookup(const char *str, int create)
{
    struct wordrec *curr = NULL;
    unsigned long hash = hashs_tring(str);
    struct wordrec *wp = table[hash];
    for (curr = wp; curr != NULL; curr = currâˆ’>next)
        /*search */ ;
notfound:
    if(create) /*add to front */
        return curr;
}
```
